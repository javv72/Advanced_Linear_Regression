# Advanced_Linear_Regression


## Goals of data analysis:  

``` 
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
